# Example Configs

## Which one do I use?
- If you're using Unraid's Docker tool, this directory doesn't apply to you.
- If you think there's a chance that you'll ever want to run more than one game server, start with the `ads` config. This will launch an "ADS" instance which can be used to create other instances.
- If you want to run one specific game only, you can just use one of those configs (e.g. `factorio`)
- If you have an old McMyAdmin license (if you don't know what this is, you don't have one), then you must use the `mcmyadmin` config.
- These are just examples -- you can of course make your own config! You don't even have to use `docker compose` if you don't want to, and know what you're doing.
